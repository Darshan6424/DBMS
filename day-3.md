## Data

Data refers to raw facts and figures without context. It represents qualitative or quantitative values that can be processed to extract information.

## Information

Information is processed data that has been given context, relevance, and purpose. It is meaningful and useful for decision-making.

## Metadata

Metadata is data about data. It provides information about other data, such as the data's structure, attributes, and management.

## Data Dictionary

A data dictionary is a centralized repository of information about data, including definitions, relationships, and usage. It helps in understanding and managing data.

## Database

A database is a structured collection of data, typically organized to model relevant aspects of reality in a way that supports processes requiring information.

## Table

A table is a collection of related data entries that consists of columns and rows. Each column represents a field, and each row represents a record.

## Tuple(s)

A tuple is a single row in a table, representing a single record. It consists of values corresponding to fields.

## Field(s)

A field is a single piece of data; a column in a table that contains the same type of information for each record.

## Domain

A domain is the set of allowable values for a field. It defines the constraints on the data values that can be entered in a field.

## Constraint

Constraints are rules applied to fields to ensure data integrity and validity. Examples include primary keys, foreign keys, and unique constraints.

## Key

A key is a field or combination of fields used to identify records uniquely. Keys ensure that each record can be uniquely distinguished from others.
